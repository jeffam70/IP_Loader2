* Add AT commands
  * to set baud rate
  * to set initial RESn state?
  * to set transparent mode
  * More?

* Calculate round-trip time

* Enhance to Identify
  * Accept multiple responses
  * Set up proper Broadcast addresses
  * Use TIdStack.IsIP to check for valid IP address

* Handle errors
  * TCP connection
  * Propeller Protocol
  * Prompts

* Add TCP
  * To connect
  * To transmit image

* Consider
  * Adding Soft AP mode negotiation
  * Adding Wi-Fi Protected Setup mode (to hardware?)
  * Determine how to find local addresses and subnet masks

Things Done:
* Enhance to request acknowledgements
* Enhance to randomize header ID
* Enhance to Identify
  * Broadcast message
  * Retrieve and display Node Name
  * Retrieve and display port number
* Find and maintain desired response packet in RxBuf (last) before exiting Get/SetXBee method.

* Add AT commands
  * to set low pulse time
* Simplify CmdStream

* Handle errors
  * Invalid IP Address (255.255.255.255)
  * No acknowledgement
* Handle
  * String issues in ParameterValue
  * Zero-termination of Parameter (when receiving)
