THINGS TO DO
------------

* Add AT commands
  * to set baud rate
  * to set transparent mode
  * More?

* Calculate round-trip time

* Enhance to Identify
  * Set up proper Broadcast addresses
  * Use TIdStack.IsIP to check for valid IP address

* Handle errors
  * TCP connection
  * Propeller Protocol
  * Prompts

* Add TCP
  * To connect
  * To transmit image

* Consider
  * Adding Soft AP mode negotiation
  * Adding Wi-Fi Protected Setup mode (to hardware?)
  * Determine how to find local addresses and subnet masks


THINGS DONE
-----------

* Enhance to request acknowledgements
* Enhance to randomize header ID
* Enhance to Identify
  * Broadcast message
  * Retrieve and display Node Name
  * Retrieve and display IP Address
  * Retrieve and display port number
  * Retrieve and display MAC address
  * Create Pseudo-Communication port number
  * Accept multiple responses

* Find and maintain desired response packet in RxBuf (last) before exiting Get/SetXBee method.

* Add AT commands
  * to set low pulse time
  * to set RESn state
  * to get MAC Address

* Simplify CmdStream

* Handle errors
  * Invalid IP Address (255.255.255.255)
  * No acknowledgement

* Handle
  * String issues in ParameterValue
  * Zero-termination of Parameter (when receiving)


THINGS TO PONDER
----------------

* Use the form "XB####" in place of a "COM#" to select the desired wireless port to download to.  The #### is based on the last digits of the XBee's MAC address.
* For boards that include a USB and an XBee socket, replace the USB circuit with one that behaves like an XBee USB Adapter (when and XBee is attached) and like
  a normal USB connection when not.
  * This may still have to be a switched mechanism
    * Can use a 2-position switch to flip between USB and XBee downloading
    * The switch will activate a simple transistor circuit to mux USB and XBee to Rx, Tx, and RESn.
