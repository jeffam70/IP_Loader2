Introduction
============

This is the code and resources used during R&D of the protocol to download to the Propeller over Wi-Fi using the XBee Wi-Fi S6B modules.

This project is based in Delphi XE6, compiled to run on Windows 32-bit or 64-bit.  It "may" also be compiled to Mac OS X; though that has not
been tested.
